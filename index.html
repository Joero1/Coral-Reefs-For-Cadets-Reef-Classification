 <h1>Classifying Reef Organisms</h1>
  <br>
 <h2>Benthic Components</h2>
 <p>The biological component of the seafloor of coral reefs consists primarily of these four groups...</p>
 <p><strong>Hard Corals</strong><br>
 This group is the main reason why other animals come to the reef. They provide rigid structural support that isn't effectively provided by softer benthic organisms. Hard corals have a hard calcium carbonate skeleton (i.e. case). This skeleton is preserved after the living components of the polyps die.</p>

  <p><strong>Soft Corals</strong><br>
 These corals only produce a small amount of calcium carbonate - not enough to produce a rigid skeleton. This means they are flexible and sway with the water movement. Although they do not provide as much structural support for most animals, they still act as important habitat for many and often have important antibacterial properties that help to keep the reef free of diseases.</p>

  <p><strong>Sponges</strong><br>
 Sponges are the most primitive animals that are still alive. They obtain food by passing water through their system and holding onto organic matter that passes through. This is called filter feeding. This helps the reef as it keeps the nutrient levels in the water low enough for corals to thrive as it reduces the chance of algal takeover. They also provide habitat for a number of animals, such as brittle stars. They are also food for some organisms such as turtles. However, most organisms find them unappetising as sponges have evolved small calcium carbonate structures inside them to deter animals from eating them.</p>

  <p><strong>Seaweed</strong><br>
 Macroalgae (a.k.a. 'seaweed') is often loosely referred to as a 'plant', even by scientists. But it is really only distantly related to 'true' plants. Seaweed is an important food source for many animals. However most coral reefs are suffering from seaweed takeover. Seaweed grows much faster than coral and often outcompetes it for space and sunlight. Seaweed can be grouped into green, brown or red macroalgae. Green algae is restricted to the very shallow waters.</p>

  <p>There are a few other sessile organisms that grow on the sea floor. These include anemones, feather stars, tunicates and more.</p>

  <h2>Animal Phyla</h2>
  <p>Coral reefs contain far more evolutionary groups than any other ecosystem on Earth. They contain 32 out of the 36 animal phyla (groups) that have been discovered. However, if you go diving on a reef, chances are every animal that you will encounter and see with your naked eye will belong to the following eight...</p>
  <p><strong>Annelida</strong><br>
  These are the segmented worms. It is the same phylum as the worms that you find in your garden. 'Annelid' means "little ring". Annelids on coral reefs include polychaete worms, christmas tree worms and feather duster worms. Many species have frilly appendages which are mainly used for catching particles of food. Worms also often take refuge by drilling into the reef. This increases the structural complexity of reefs by opening up spaces that serve as microhabitats for small organisms.</p>

  <p><strong>Arthropoda</strong><br>
 Means "jointed feet". They possess a hard exoskeleton. In the ocean, arthropods are predomonantly crustaceans. They can be thought of as being like the insects of the sea. On reefs they include crabs, lobsters and shrimp. There are also many parasitic species that latch on to fish and feed on their tissues. However many crustaceans are also cleaners that help to <em>remove</em> parasites from fish that they will feed on.</p>

  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/pederson13.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  
  <p><strong>Chordata</strong><br>
 This is our own phylum. 'Chordata' means "having a cord". It encompasses all vertebrates (fish, mammals, reptires, birds and amphibians) as well as a few non-vertebrate relatives (e.g tunicates). The defining characteristic is that all members of this group have at least a basic spinal cord in at least one life stage.</p>

  <p><strong>Cnidaria</strong><br>
 'Cnidaria' means "sea nettle". This is arguably the most keystone phylum on reefs as it includes coral. It also includes jellyfish, anemones and a few other groups. They all possess stinging cells and lack true brains, possessing only a basic net nervous system. They can exist as a single individual (e.g. jellyfish) or as colonies (e.g. corals).</p>

  <p><strong>Echinodermata</strong><br>
 Means "porcupine skin". This group includes sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins and feather stars. One defining feature is that they hav a water vascular system that they use for movement. They push water through a network of chambers which enables them to move. Echinoderms are very important grazers that help to keep algae levels down on the reef.</p>

  <p><strong>Mollusca</strong><br>
 Means "soft-bodied". This group includes slugs, snails, bivalves (a.k.a. 'shellfish'), and cephalopods (i.e. octopus, squids and cuttlefish). One defining feature is the possession of a mantle cavity. That is an anatomical structure that contains most of their vital organs. Cephalopods are the most neurologically complex and intelligent invertebrates on the planet.</p>

  <p><strong>Platyhelminthes</strong><br>
 Means "flatworm", which is also their lamen name. They are very primitive. Unlike annelids, they are not segmented. Their flat body allows gas and nutrients to be transported easily throughout their anatomy.</p>

  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/leopardflatworm4.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  
  <p><strong>Porifera</strong><br>
 Means "bearing pores". These are the sponges. They are the oldest living animal phylum. They are all sessile (attached to the sea floor) and have bodies full of pores and channels to allow water circulation so that they can effectively collect particles of food from the water. This helps to maintain optimum nutrient levels in the water, and are therefore important for improving the water quality on reefs. They also provide habitat for small organisms including juvenile fish and brittle stars. The cells of sponges have an unusual ability to transform to other types and relocate around the body.</p>

 <h2>Two Types of Fish</h2>
 <p><strong>Bony Fish (Teleosts)</strong><br>
  This group is extremely diverse and makes up the majority of fish on the planet. They have hard bony skeletons much like we do. They have conquored both the marine and freshwater environment. About 60% of species live in the ocean. They have a special organ called a swim bladder that is used to control buoyancy as they swim. The swim bladder contains air that gets pumped into a sack when pressure increases. This helps to keep the fish neutrally buoyant so that they don't sink.

 <p><strong>Cartilagenous Fish (Elasmobranchs)</strong><br>
  This group consists of all sharks and rays, as well as a few other groups such as the skates and guitar fish. About 95% of elasmobranch species are marine and they are exclusively carnivorous (with the exception of the bonnethead shark which can eat grass!). Unlike bony fish, elasmobranchs do not have swim bladders. Instead they control their buoyancy with a fatty substance called squalene. The deeper they go, the more squalene must be produced to stay neutrally buoyant. Elasmobranchs also have a special ability to detect electric signals in the water and this can help them detect prey and predators.</p>

  <h2>Fish Families</h2>
  <p>Even if you cannot identify a fish species, you can often identify it's family. Members of the same family typically share common shapes and other characteristics. Below are some of the most common fish families seen on coral reefs, but there are more.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Angelfish</strong><br>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/d3/ce/abd3cec692e457e9a2c3370467f4b8c5.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/grayangel16.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.lobstertrapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/p_1125-2689-QUEEN-ANGELFISH.jpg?fit=558%2C378&ssl=1" height="120" width="170"><br>
Angelfish are among a number of fish families that have laterally compressed body shapes. This has two main advantages. It reduces drag in the water for efficient swimming. It also gives the impression of having a large body size that may be perceived as threatening or too big to handle as prey, whilst actually having a relatively small biomass and therefore not too demanding to acquire sufficient food. Relative to other laterally compressed fish, angelfish have a roughly oval-shaped front-end and rectangular bottom-end.</p>
  
<p><strong>Barracuda</strong><br>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Barracuda_laban.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Torpedo shaped silver carnivores. They can reach rapid speeds very quickly.</p>
  
<p><strong>Basslets</strong><br>

Small with two long pectoral fins.</p>
  
<p><strong>Boxfish</strong><br>

  <img src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/f1/2b/2f/dive-dominica.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Laterally compressed. Generally smaller than angelfish and more oval-shaped from the side. They are important herbivores on reefs and have a protruding snouts that enable them to be selective with what they pick off the reef.</p>

<p><strong>Conger Eels</strong><br>
  <img src="https://reefbuilders.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2020/02/Heteroconger-guttatus-dark-spot.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Flexible and wormlike</p>

<p><strong>Damselfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/duskydamsel3.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Chromis_cyanea_Gratwicke.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/sergeantmajor6.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Have a generic ‘goldfish-like’ shape. Their fins are typically quite rounded. They are often referred to as ‘farmers’ of the reef. They often have well-defined territories, hereby they allow algae to grow that serves as food. They will defend their territories vigorously (including from scuba divers!).</p>

<p><strong>Drumfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/spotteddrum10.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Very accentuated dorsal fins</p>

<p><strong>Filefish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/slenderfile8.jpg" height="120" width="170">

  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/whitespottedfile9.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <br>
Have a wonky ‘diamond-shaped’ body. When they swim, their body stays rigid so all the propulsion is through the fins.</p>

<p><strong>Flounder</strong><br>
Very flat and highly camouflaged. Spend most of their time on the sediment.</p>

<p><strong>Flying Fish</strong><br>
The pectoral fins have evolved to be big and powerful so as to act like wings that enable them to escape prey by thrusting out of the water and fluttering to safety. Their “flight” can reach 70 km/h and will typically cover as much as 50m, however they have been known to reach up to 400m if they catch the right updrafts at the leading edge of the waves.</p>

<p><strong>Goatfish</strong><br>
Have two appendages underneath the mouth that are highly sensitive and are used to rummage through sediment to find food.</p>

<p><strong>Gobies</strong><br>
Most species are just a few cm long when fully grown. They often serve as important cleaners on the reef as they feed on parasites that are infesting other fish.</p>

<p><strong>Grunts</strong><br>
Rounded on top, slightly flatter on bottom. Important carnivores on reefs. Catch small prey.</p>

<p><strong>Jacks</strong><br>
Generally pelagic silvery fish found in groups.</p>

<p><strong>Jawfish</strong><br>
Live inside burrows that they create in the sand. They create their tunnels by filling their mouths with sand and then spitting it out elsewhere – they are also territorial of their burrows. They are mouthbrooders which means that their eggs hatch in their hatch in their mouths. This ensures that eggs are protected from predation.</p>

<p><strong>Lizard Fish</strong><br>
Spends much of the time conserving energy by sitting on the benthos.</p>

<p><strong>Mackerel</strong><br>
Fast pelagic silvery fish, often targeted by fishermen.</p>

<p><strong>Moray Eels</strong><br>
Carnivorous. Species vary in length from just over one foot to over 3m. Look in crevices for morays seeking shelter.</p>

<p><strong>Needlefish</strong><br>
Needle-shaped silver fish commonly found in shallow waters. They can dart quickly to escape predation.</p>

<p><strong>Parrotfish</strong><br>
Parrotfish have the greatest functional impact of all herbivorous fish on the reef. They have hardened beak-like mouths that enable them to chomp on the reef. They are targeting the algae but are unprecise as they eat so will consume calcified bits of the reef as well. This small amount of disturbance is actually beneficial  as it increases benthic diversity by enabling other organisms to grow on the recently exposed benthos. The non-digestible parts they consume are excreted out as sand, thus building up the tropical beaches that many people enjoy. Most parrotfish species have colours that differ drastically between sexes. Males tend to have more vibrant colours. Most parrotfish are hermaphroditic, starting life as females. A single male will live in a group of females, gaining a large amount of fertilization success. If a male is removed from the group, hormones in one of the females will signal her to transform into a male.</p>

<p><strong>Porcupinefish</strong><br>
Swat and box-like shape but more rounded than boxfish. They can puff up when threatened to double their size and make their spines more erect.</p>

<p><strong>Porgies</strong><br>
Normally silvery with rather prominent foreheads.</p>

<p><strong>Pufferfish</strong><br>
Like porcupinefish, pufferfish can puff up when threatened. The spines of pufferfish are thinner than those of porcupinefish and are therefore normally only visible when they puff.</p>

<p><strong>Scorpionfish</strong><br>
Scorpionfish are the most venomous fish family. They are covered in stinging spines that are coated in a venomous mucus. The majority are benthic dwelling ambush predators.</p>

<p><strong>Sea Horse</strong><br>
The latin name for seahorse means ‘horse caterpillar’. They are fish but unlike others, they have an exoskeleton and no scales. Sea horses mate for life. The effs are transferred from the female to the male where they are stored in a specialized pouch and then fertilized. Adults will eat 30-50 times per day. Their eyesight is very strong and eyes can move independently of one another and therefore they can look forward and backward at the same time. This allows them to both hunt and be on the look out for potential predators at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Serranids (Groupers, Hamlets and Bass)</strong><br>
Bodies are somewhat rounded. Groupers are usually ambush predators that have relatively large mouths useful for sucking in prey.</p>

<p><strong>Snappers</strong><br>
Very generic fish shape (almost like the biblical fish symbol). Snappers look very similar to grunts. They are important carnivores on the reef and are therefore a good indicator of reef health.</p>

<p><strong>Surgeonfish</strong><br>
Laterally compressed. Crucial herbivorous fish on the reef, second only to parrotfish in terms of their influence on keeping algae down.</p>

<p><strong>Squirrelfish</strong><br>
Solitary fish. Very large eyes. Tend to loiter on small home ranges.</p>

<p><strong>Triggerfish</strong><br>
Diamond-like shape. They use their upper and lower fins to propel through the water. They can be highly territorial. Their territories are cone-shaped and extend upwards.</p>

<p><strong>Trumpetfish</strong><br>
Elongated with a rigid body and elongated snout. When threatened will often become vertical to blend in with surrounding growth on the reef.</p>

<p><strong>Wrasses</strong><br>
Cigar-shaped.</p>
