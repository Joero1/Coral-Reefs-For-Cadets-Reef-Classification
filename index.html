  <h2>Benthic Components</h2>
  <p>The biological component of the seafloor of coral reefs consists primarily of these four groups...</p>
  <h3>Hard Corals</h3>
  <p>This group is the main reason why other animals come to the reef. They provide rigid structural support that isn't effectively provided by softer benthic organisms. Hard corals have a hard calcium carbonate skeleton (i.e. case). This skeleton is preserved after the living components of the polyps die.</p>
  <h3>Soft Corals</h3>
  <p>These corals only produce a small amount of calcium carbonate - not enough to produce a rigid skeleton. This means they are flexible and sway with the water movement. Although they do not provide as much structural support for most animals, they still act as important habitat for many and often have important antibacterial properties that help to keep the reef free of diseases.</p>
  <h3>Sponges</h3>
  <p>Sponges are the most primitive animals that are still alive. They obtain food by passing water through their system and holding onto organic matter that passes through. This is called filter feeding. This helps the reef as it keeps the nutrient levels in the water low enough for corals to thrive as it reduces the chance of algal takeover. They also provide habitat for a number of animals, such as brittle stars. They are also food for some organisms such as turtles. However, most organisms find them unappetising as sponges have evolved small calcium carbonate structures inside them to deter animals from eating them.</p>
  <h3>Seaweed</h3>
  <p>Macroalgae (a.k.a. 'seaweed') is often loosely referred to as a 'plant', even by scientists. But it is really only distantly related to 'true' plants. Seaweed is an important food source for many animals. However most coral reefs are suffering from seaweed takeover. Seaweed grows much faster than coral and often outcompetes it for space and sunlight. Seaweed can be grouped into green, brown or red macroalgae. Green algae is restricted to the very shallow waters.</p>
  <p>There are a few other sessile organisms that grow on the sea floor. These include anemones, feather stars, tunicates and more.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Animal Phyla</h2>
  <p>Coral reefs contain far more evolutionary groups than any other ecosystem on Earth. They contain 32 out of the 36 animal phyla (groups) that have been discovered. However, if you go diving on a reef, chances are every animal that you will encounter and see with your naked eye will belong to the following eight...</p>
  <h3>Phylum Annelida</h3>
  <p>These are the segmented worms. It is the same phylum as the worms that you find in your garden. 'Annelid' means "little ring". Annelids on coral reefs include polychaete worms, christmas tree worms and feather duster worms. Many species have frilly appendages which are mainly used for catching particles of food. Worms also often take refuge by drilling into the reef. This increases the structural complexity of reefs by opening up spaces that serve as microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
 <h3>Phylum Arthropoda</h3>
 <p>Means "jointed feet". They possess a hard exoskeleton. In the ocean, arthropods are predomonantly crustaceans. They can be thought of as being like the insects of the sea. On reefs they include crabs, lobsters and shrimp. There are also many parasitic species that latch on to fish and feed on their tissues. However many crustaceans are also cleaners that help to <em>remove</em> parasites from fish that they will feed on.</p>
 <h3>Phylum Chordata</h3>
 <p>This is our own phylum. 'Chordata' means "having a cord". It encompasses all vertebrates (fish, mammals, reptires, birds and amphibians) as well as a few non-vertebrate relatives (e.g tunicates). The defining characteristic is that all members of this group have at least a basic spinal cord in at least one life stage.</p>
 <h3>Phylum Cnidaria</h3>
 <p>'Cnidaria' means "sea nettle". This is arguably the most keystone phylum on reefs as it includes coral. It also includes jellyfish, anemones and a few other groups. They all possess stinging cells and lack true brains, possessing only a basic net nervous system. They can exist as a single individual (e.g. jellyfish) or as colonies (e.g. corals).</p>
 <h3>Phylum Echinodermata</h3>
 <p>Means "porcupine skin". This group includes sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins and feather stars. One defining feature is that they hav a water vascular system that they use for movement. They push water through a network of chambers which enables them to move. Echinoderms are very important grazers that help to keep algae levels down on the reef.</p>
 <h3>Phylum Mollusca</h3>
 <p>Means "soft-bodied". This group includes slugs, snails, bivalves (a.k.a. 'shellfish'), and cephalopods (i.e. octopus, squids and cuttlefish). One defining feature is the possession of a mantle cavity. That is an anatomical structure that contains most of their vital organs. Cephalopods are the most neurologically complex and intelligent invertebrates on the planet.</p>
 <h3>Phylum Platyhelminthes</h3>
 <p>Means "flatworm", which is also their lamen name. They are very primitive. Unlike annelids, they are not segmented. Their flat body allows gas and nutrients to be transported easily throughout their anatomy.</p>
 <h3>Phylum Porifiera</h3>
 <p>Means "bearing pores". These are the sponges. They are the oldest living animal phylum. They are all sessile (attached to the sea floor) and have bodies full of pores and channels to allow water circulation so that they can effectively collect particles of food from the water. This helps to maintain optimum nutrient levels in the water, and are therefore important for improving the water quality on reefs. They also provide habitat for small organisms including juvenile fish and brittle stars. The cells of sponges have an unusual ability to transform to other types and relocate around the body.</p>

 <h2>Coral Biology</h2>
 <p><strong>Species</strong><br>
 There are an estimated 600-800 species of hard corals. Estimates vary depending on sources. There is some disagreement regarding what counts as separate species and what is merely two sub-members of one species.) The number of soft coral species is even harder to determine.</p>
 <p><strong>Anatomy</strong><br>
 The fleshy part of the coral is called a <strong>polyp</strong>. Each polyp has tentacles that allow the corals to catch food. The entire coral structure consists of genetically identical polyps, produced asexually from one another. The polyp absorbs calcium carbonate from the surrounding water and secretes it around itself to provide a hard protective structure. This structure is called a <strong>corallite</strong>. The texture of hard corals normally looks like bumpy stones. Each 'bumb' is a corallite and has an associated polyp living within it. The polyps are connected to one another by connective tissue. Within this tissue are tubes that allow them to equally distribute food and other resources among themselves. The polyps also contain stinging cells. These are used for defence and to inject small prey to stun them and bring them towards the 'mouth' of the polyp for consuming.</p>
 <p>Hard corals grow very slowly. This makes them vulnerable to disturbance because damaging a small piece can destroy several decades worth of growth. The first generation lays down their calcium carbonate skeleton for future generations to build upon. Only the outer layer of the coral contains living tissue.</p>
 <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br>
 Corals reproduce sexually. This allows genetic diversity. Without this, diseases would be more at risk of of wiping out entire populations. Corals can be male or female but the majority are hermaphrodites (both). They may be both at the same time or may be males in their early stage of life and then become female. Most corals reproduce by release sex cells into the water so that it may hopefully meet with those released from other colonies and fuse in the water. For this reason, corals normally synchronise their spawning by using lunar cycles, happening at very specific nights of the year. When this happens they get fertilised in the water. The larvae develops and is part of the plankton for a while before eventually finding a suitable substrate and settling on the benthos. This technique allows corals to drive far before settling, so as to spread their genes across a wide distribution. Once a larvae settles, it will grow into a polyp and start secreting calcium carbonate to stabilise itself. It will then start dividing asexually to form a new colony.</p>
 <p><strong>Zooxanthellae</strong><br>
 Zooxanthellae are type of dinoflagellate algae in the genus <em>Symbiodinium</em>. They are embedded in the fleshy tissue of the coral. Zooxanthellae are initially taken up by the coral when it is in it's larval stage in the water column but it continues to obtain them throughout it's life via it's feeding mechanisms. The striking colours of corals are provided by the zooxanthellae due to the prigments they possess to absorb various lightwaves. A typical coral obtains most of it's nutrients from its zooxanthellae. These algae produce their own food using energy from the sun. The coral and the zooxanthellae have a <strong>symbiotic relationship</strong>. This means that they benefit each other. The coral gains carbohydrates from the zooxanthellae, needed to meet their energy demands. The zooxanthellae gain protection from the coral. They can exist freely in the water column but are more likely to be grazed by animals if they do. The zooxanthellae can also make use of some of the metabolic waste products from the coral, e.g. carbon dioxide and ammonium. Scientists group zooxanthellae by clades from A to E. Each clade has slight differences in their properties.</p>
 <p><strong>Other Feeding Mechanisms</strong><br>
  A typical coral obtains about 80% of its nutrients from the photosynthesis of zooxanthellae. The other 20% comes from consuming other animals. The deeper down a coral lives, the more this percentage increases due to a decrease in sunlight. The polyps have sticky tentacles that can catch plankton and pass them to the mouth of the polyp where they will be ingested. The coral's stinging cells are also used for catching slightly larger prey. They are sensitive to vibrations in the water. When they detect prey swimming by, they trigger a small appendage called a cnidocyte that will fire into the prey and real it in to be ingested. The cnidocyte typically contains neurotoxins that disorientate and immobilize the prey.</p>
